# `brainfuck` example

This crate contains an advanced example of a full brainfuck interpreter, with error reporting and a small command-line UI.

The main file ([`src/main.rs`](src/main.rs)) creates the VM and attaches the required auxiliary components, and runs the program whose source code can be found in [`src/source.lasm`](src/source.lasm).
